        <h1>Hi and Welcome</h1>
    <h1>Find your <span class="orange-color">Nutrition Charts</span> here</h1>
    <p>The concept of a balanced diet chart has existed long before nutritionists and dieticians started expounding its virtues. Our ancestors traditionally ate meals with an emphasis on balancing all nutritional elements and food groups, an aspect that has been diluted with time and lifestyle changes. So what exactly does a balanced diet entail? The dictionary defines it as a diet comprising a variety of different types of food and providing adequate amounts of the nutrients needed for good health. So the keyword here is a balance â€“ everything must be consumed in balance, and in proportion to what the body needs.</p>
